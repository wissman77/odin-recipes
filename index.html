  <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
  <p>The earliest known written recipes date to 1730 BC and were recorded on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform" target="_blank">cuneiform</a> tablets found in Mesopotamia.</p>
  <p>Other early written recipes date from approximately 1600 BC and come from an Akkadian tablet from southern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia" target="_blank">Babylonia</a>.</p>
  <p>There are also works in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" target="_blank">ancient Egyptian</a> hieroglyphs depicting the preparation of food.</p>
  <p>Many ancient Greek recipes are known. Mithaecus's cookbook was an early one, but most of it has been lost; Athenaeus quotes one short recipe in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deipnosophistae" target="_blank">Deipnosophistae</a>. Athenaeus mentions many other cookbooks, all of them lost.</p>
  <p>Roman recipes are known starting in the 2nd century BCE with Cato the Elder's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_agri_cultura" target="_blank">De Agri Cultura</a>. Many authors of this period described eastern Mediterranean cooking in Greek and in Latin. Some Punic recipes are known in Greek and Latin translation</p>
