  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Delicious and bursting with flavor, Asian lettuce wraps are a great idea for entertaining or a family style meal. Each person can build their own fresh, delicious wrap. Just be sure to have plates or napkins available since the mixture can sometimes drip a little. To serve, allow each person to spoon a portion of the meat into a lettuce leaf. Wrap the lettuce around the meat like a burrito and enjoy!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>16 Boston Bibb or butter lettuce leaves</li>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons minced pickled ginger</li>
    <li>1 dash Asian chile pepper sauce, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) can water chestnuts, drained and finely chopped</li>

  <h1>Steps</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Rinse whole lettuce leaves and pat dry, being careful not tear them. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and cooking oil in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease; transfer beef to a bowl. Cook and stir onion in the same skillet used for beef until slightly tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir hoisin sauce, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, and chile pepper sauce into onions. Add water chestnuts, green onions, sesame oil, and cooked beef; cook and stir until the onions just begin to wilt, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Arrange lettuce leaves around the outer edge of a large serving platter and pile meat mixture in the center.</li>
